MY PORTFOLIO
This is a portfolio for potential employers to review to get a quick overview of my work experience and to demonstrate my ability as a programmer. 
It will contain a standard CV as well for employers looking for a more traditional resume. This version is however more user friendly and pleasant to look abilitygiving a quick synopsis of my experience and abilities.

UX
User stories

First Time Visitor Goals
My intention is to ensure that they find it easy to navigate the site and that the content is useful and user friendly
It has to be visually appealing so that they will want to return.
It should be informative and make them want to pick up the phone and give me an interview.

Returning Visitor Goals
My intention is to provide access to further information and queries as they have had time to think and discuss with others my resume.
They would likely want to readily have access to contact information where their question can be answered and have access to a formal standard CV.

Frequent User Goals
They would want to have ready information to my contact details should they wish to call me for an interview.
They would like want access to a summary of my skills if they're considering shortlisting me and comparing my skills to other candidates.
That being the case I would like my skills to be favourably presented and readily available.

Design
Colour Scheme
I will stick to autumn colors as much as possible to match the first page, but add some reds and greens to breathe life into the pages.
Typography
The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
Imagery
Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be add an air of mystery that will attract fantasy lovers to this mystical place. I will try to balance it out by infusing energy and fun into other pages images.

Wireframes
Home Page Wireframe – needs to be amended but to late. 
Mobile Wireframe - View
Contact Us Page Wireframe - View
I used an excel file for the wire frames due to time constraints, I am comfortable and familiar with it and I wanted a vivid clear structure. I have purchased a drawing tablet but I have not had the time to get familiar with it. I have saved it as a web link below.
Y:\ADHOC YOL\Personal\Full Stack\Wire Frame Web Document.mht
(The above link only opens in explorer).

Features
I followed the structure from Code Institute Mini Project with Bootstrap so I could have a set up guide.
I borrowed code from the Love Running project such as the font.
Page one
This is the home page, designed to be intriguing and mystical that should draw the users into the site.
Page two
This is full of the four main activities and s intended to provide activities for like minded people. It also has links to the latest updates and reviews for gamers. Both gamers and movie buffs can arrange socialise vial online chat rooms.
Page three
Page to sign up for membership and news letter, ran out of time to add newsletter.
Existing Features
The idea is that this is a growing site with more activities to be added, open to suggestions to make it interactive and inclusive and more discounted tours are to be sort.
Would have loved to improve my images, add proper radio buttons etc..

(by Stuart Hart found on google)
Copied most of the styling from Code Institute Love running, noteably the animation styling.

Code Institute
For the coding, most if not all was borrowed or advised from the modules.
Much of the structure and coding was from the love running lessons and the resume project
https://love-running--blackkite.repl.co/
Git
Git was used via the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git. 

Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
•	W3C Markup Validator - Results
•	W3C CSS Validator - Results

Deployment
I started out by setting creating a Git pod project on Git hub.
Set up a new README.md file and renamed the Code Institute one to distinguish them.
I copied the BootstrapCDN link into my style.css file and set the 3 pages, [Home (index.html), Activities (activities.html) & Sign Up (sign-up.html)]
I started with my background image to set the tone for myself to work in.
I created a Wireframe in word, I emailed ideas to myself from my mobile and pasted them into the word doc so I could take note of ideas while on the go
It is nothing like what I wanted but I am confident with more time I can bring up the standar. The last page was especially diassapointing as I ran out of time to make the image more UX
